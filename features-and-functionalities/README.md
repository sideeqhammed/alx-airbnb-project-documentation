## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### Database Management
- Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- Required tables:
  - Users (guests and hosts)
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Reviews
  - Payments

### API Development
- Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
- Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
  - GET (retrieve data)
  - POST (create data)
  - PUT/PATCH (update data)
  - DELETE (remove data)
- Use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

### Authentication and Authorization
- Use JWT for secure user sessions.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
  - Guests
  - Hosts
  - Admins

### File Storage (Scenario based)
- Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary. For implementation, we will use file storage

### Third-Party Services
- Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

### Error Handling and Logging
- Implement global error handling for APIs.

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

###Scalability
- Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.

### Security
- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
- Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

### Performance Optimization
- Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
- Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

### Testing
- Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
- Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
